        The GFRV composite was constructed from two parts: vitrimer polymer and woven glass fibre sheets. The vitrimer polymer was prepared by mixing a stoichiometric ratio (1:1:5 mol% to the acid) of epoxy (EPON 828, Skygeek), adipic acid (Sigma Aldrich) and 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD, Sigma Aldrich). The aluminum surface was treated with nitrogen plasma at a power of 45 W for a duration of 20 minutes, producing a carbon footprint of 0.4 kg CO2e per kWh. 1 gram copper and 2 grams gold.
